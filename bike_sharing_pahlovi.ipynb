        "\n",
        "Bike-sharing systems are a new generation of traditional bike rentals where the whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic. Through these systems, the user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back to another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which are composed of over 500 thousand bicycles. Today, there exists a great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental, and health issues.\n",

        "'Travel Along' is a new bike-sharing company and wants to expand its customer count and provide better services at a reasonable cost. They have conducted several surveys and collated the data about weather, weekends, holidays, etc. from the past 2 years.\n",
        "\n",
        "As a recently hired data scientist at 'Travel Along', you have been asked to analyze the patterns in the data and figure out the key areas which can help the organization to grow and manage the customer demands. Further, you need to use this information to predict the count of bikes shared so that the company can take prior decisions for surge hours.\n",
